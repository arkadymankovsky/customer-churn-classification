# Customer Churn Classification Project

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze customer data and build a model that can identify customers who are likely to leave the service.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── churn_data.csv         # Dataset containing customer information
├── exercise.ipynb         # Jupyter notebook with analysis and modeling
└── Atidot - DS Assignment.pdf  # Project requirements and specifications
```

## Dataset

The project uses the `churn_data.csv` file which contains customer information and churn status. The dataset includes various features that can be used to predict customer churn.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies (if any)
3. Open the `exercise.ipynb` notebook to view the analysis and modeling process

## Analysis

The analysis is conducted in the Jupyter notebook (`exercise.ipynb`), which includes:
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model development and evaluation
- Results visualization

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (to be listed based on the notebook dependencies)
